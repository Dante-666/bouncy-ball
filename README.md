# bouncy-ball
A hello world game for exploring g3d capabilities

## Ground rules
1. Don't add .gitignore files and build files as we are developing cross-platform.
2. Issues must be atomic. Keep dividing them until atomicity is reached.
3. Ensure that you communicate and tag the issue when working on it so that we don't get
redundant work. In case of conflicting ideas in implementation, we will have an exception.
