# bouncy-ball
A hello world game for exploring g3d capabilities

This turned out to be a good exercise, bullet was integrated well and I understood how the UI and elements work.

Things to take forward,
1. Add better support for constraints.
2. Syncing Node to Physics and Physics to Node flags for edit support

'''!!This project is deprecated for now, I will try to push for a demo + PhysX integration with g3d codebase itself!!'''

## Ground rules
1. Don't add .gitignore files and build files as we are developing cross-platform.
2. Issues must be atomic. Keep dividing them until atomicity is reached.
3. Ensure that you communicate and tag the issue when working on it so that we don't get
redundant work. In case of conflicting ideas in implementation, we will have an exception.
